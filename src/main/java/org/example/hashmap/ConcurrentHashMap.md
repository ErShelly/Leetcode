A ConcurrentHashMap in Java 8 is a thread-safe and high-performance implementation of the Map interface. 
It was introduced in earlier versions of Java but underwent significant improvements in Java 8, 
making it more efficient and scalable in multi-threaded environments.


Key Features of ConcurrentHashMap in Java 8:

Lock Striping to Reduce Contention:
Java 8's ConcurrentHashMap replaces the old segment-based locking mechanism with a bucket-level locking mechanism using CAS (Compare-And-Swap) operations and fine-grained locks only when necessary.
It uses a single array of buckets (nodes) instead of segmented maps, reducing the overhead of managing locks.

Improved Scalability with Node Structure:
Each bucket contains a Node (or linked list/tree) to store entries.
If a bucket's size exceeds a threshold (usually 8), it converts to a balanced binary tree (TreeNode) for faster lookups, improving performance for hash collisions.
Non-Blocking Reads:

Read operations are lock-free and use volatile reads or CAS operations, ensuring high-speed, thread-safe access.

Thread-Safe Writes: Write operations (e.g., put, remove) are thread-safe due to synchronized blocks or CAS operations on specific buckets or nodes.

Iterators and Views: The iterators returned by ConcurrentHashMap are weakly consistent, meaning they reflect the state of the map at the time of their creation and do not throw ConcurrentModificationException.
Provides various views like keySet, values, and entrySet for easy iteration.
Common Methods in ConcurrentHashMap
Basic Operations:

The term "bucket-level locking" in the context of ConcurrentHashMap refers to the mechanism by which thread-safety is achieved while allowing high concurrency. While Java 8's ConcurrentHashMap does not strictly use explicit locks at the bucket level, it employs a combination of fine-grained synchronization and non-blocking operations (like CAS) to operate on individual buckets or entries. Let's break this down:

Buckets in HashMap and ConcurrentHashMap
In a hash-based data structure like ConcurrentHashMap, the data is stored in an array of "buckets."
Each bucket corresponds to a slot in the underlying array, determined by the hash of the key.
What Bucket-Level Locking Means
Bucket-level locking refers to controlling access to specific buckets rather than locking the entire map. This allows multiple threads to operate on different buckets concurrently without interfering with each other.
If two threads try to access or modify entries in different buckets, they can do so simultaneously.
This granular approach improves performance compared to locking the entire map.
ConcurrentHashMap in Java 8: A Hybrid Approach
While earlier versions of ConcurrentHashMap (pre-Java 8) used segment-based locking, Java 8 replaced this with a more fine-grained, bucket-level strategy, using:

CAS (Compare-And-Swap) Operations:
CAS is a non-blocking atomic operation that updates a memory location only if it contains an expected value.
ConcurrentHashMap uses CAS to modify individual buckets or entries without acquiring locks.
Synchronized Blocks:
For operations that involve complex updates (e.g., resizing, replacing elements in a linked list or tree), the map uses synchronized blocks, but only on the specific bucket or node being modified.
This minimizes contention and keeps locks local to the bucket.


CAS (Compare-And-Swap) is an atomic operation widely used in concurrent programming to achieve thread-safe updates to shared variables without requiring locks. It's a hardware-supported instruction provided by modern CPUs, which makes it both fast and efficient for certain types of operations.

How CAS Works
The Compare-And-Swap operation works as follows:

The processor compares the current value at a memory location to an expected value.
If the current value matches the expected value:
The processor updates the memory location with a new value.
If the current value does not match the expected value:
The processor does nothing and returns the current value, indicating the operation failed.
This operation is atomic, meaning no other thread or process can interrupt it.

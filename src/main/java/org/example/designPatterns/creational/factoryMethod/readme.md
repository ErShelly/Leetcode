    The Factory Method Design Pattern is a creational design pattern used in software development. It provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass while allowing subclasses to specify the types of objects they create.

    This pattern simplifies the object creation process by placing it in a dedicated method, promoting loose coupling between the object creator and the objects themselves.
    This approach enhances flexibility, extensibility, and maintainability, enabling subclasses to implement their own factory methods for creating specific object types.
    When to Use the Factory Method Design Pattern
    Below is when to use factory method design pattern:

    If your object creation process is complex or varies under different conditions, using a factory method can make your client code simpler and promote reusability.
    The Factory Method Pattern allows you to create objects through an interface or abstract class, hiding the details of concrete implementations. This reduces dependencies and makes it easier to modify or expand the system without affecting existing code.
    If your application needs to create different versions of a product or may introduce new types in the future, the Factory Method Pattern provides a flexible way to handle these variations by defining specific factory methods for each product type.
    Factories can also encapsulate configuration logic, allowing clients to customize the object creation process by providing parameters or options to the factory method.
    Components of Factory Method Design Pattern

    Below are the main components of Factory Design Pattern:

    Creator: This is an abstract class or an interface that declares the factory method. The creator typically contains a method that serves as a factory for creating objects. It may also contain other methods that work with the created objects.
    Concrete Creator: Concrete Creator classes are subclasses of the Creator that implement the factory method to create specific types of objects. Each Concrete Creator is responsible for creating a particular product.
    Product: This is the interface or abstract class for the objects that the factory method creates. The Product defines the common interface for all objects that the factory method can create.
    Concrete Product: Concrete Product classes are the actual objects that the factory method creates. Each Concrete Product class implements the Product interface or extends the Product abstract class.


        Use Cases of the Factory Method 
        Below are the main use cases of factory method design pattern:

        Used in JDBC for creating connections and in frameworks like Spring for managing beans.
        Libraries like Swing and JavaFX use factories to create flexible UI components.
        Tools like Log4j rely on factories to create configurable loggers.
        Factories help create objects from serialized data, supporting various formats.
        Advantages of the Factory Method
        Below are the main advantages of factory method design pattern:

        Separates creation logic from client code, improving flexibility.
        New product types can be added easily.
        Simplifies unit testing by allowing mock product creation.
        Centralizes object creation logic across the application.
        Hides specific product classes from clients, reducing dependency.
        Disadvantages of the Factory Method
        Below are the main advantages of factory method design pattern:

        Adds more classes and interfaces, which can complicate maintenance.
        Slight performance impacts due to polymorphism.
        Concrete creators are linked to their products.
        Clients need knowledge of specific subclasses.
        May lead to unnecessary complexity if applied too broadly.
        Factory logic can be harder to test.

The volatile keyword in programming (notably in languages like Java and C++) is used to indicate that a variable's value may be modified by multiple threads concurrently. It serves to inform the compiler and runtime system about how the variable should be treated in the context of multithreading to ensure visibility and ordering of updates.

Key Features of volatile in Multithreading:
Visibility Guarantee:

In a multithreaded environment, the volatile keyword ensures that the value of the variable is always read from and written to the main memory, not from a thread's local cache.
This guarantees that when one thread modifies a volatile variable, other threads can see the updated value immediately.

Prevents Caching:

The compiler and runtime system are prohibited from caching volatile variables. This ensures that each access reads the most recent value directly from memory.

Does Not Provide Atomicity:
The volatile keyword does not guarantee atomicity of operations. For example, compound actions like count++ or count = count + 1 are not thread-safe even if count is volatile, because they involve multiple steps (read-modify-write).

Does Not Replace Synchronization:
While volatile addresses visibility, it does not handle mutual exclusion or atomicity. For complex synchronization needs, you need additional mechanisms like locks (synchronized blocks in Java) or atomic classes (AtomicInteger).
